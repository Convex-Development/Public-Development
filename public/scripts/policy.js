<h2 id="sub-title" class="socialization-policy-title">4. Socialization</h2>
<p id="paragraph">We allow our users to socialize freely and safely on our site, we do this in a number of ways, which includes friending, chatting, blocking, reporting, and events. We will go into detail about each one below.</p>
<li id="list-item">Friending</li>
<p id="paragraph" style="margin-left: 5%; width: 84%;">Friending will allow you to chat users and see what content they have posted recently as well as allow you to invite them to events (Please see 4.2, Purchasing Policy). Friending a user is simple, and can be done by searching for the users profile, clicking their profile, and clicking the ‘Add Friend’ button at the right. You will be their friend when they accept your request. Unfriending can be done after your friend request has been accepted, you can unfriend the user in the same process of which you friended them.</p>
<li id="list-item">Chatting</li>
<p id="paragraph" style="margin-left: 5%; width: 84%;">You may chat with a user in one of two ways after they have accepted your friend request. The first way to chat a user can be found on your navbar, where you will find a button named ‘Chat’, clicking that will bring you to our chat page where you can see all of your recent chats, as well as be able to create new chats and/or group chats with friends. The second way to chat with a user who has accepted your friend request can be found on all of the pages accept the chat page at the bottom right hand corner of your screen. Clicking that will allow you to see a list of recent chats and also be able to create new chats with your friends.</p>
<li id="list-item">Blocking</li>
<p id="paragraph" style="margin-left: 5%; width: 84%;">Blocking a user will enable you to protect your privacy if you feel threatened by the specific user. When you have blocked a user, your profile will disappear from their view, meaning they will not be able to see your profile when they attempt to search it, look in a mutual friends list, mention you in posts, or invite you to events that they will be holding. You will not be able to see their profile either unless you are on settings under blocked, where you will be able to unblock the user. If you feel a user has done wrong to you, you may block them by going to their profile and clicking ‘Block’, which can be found at the right hand side of your screen.</p>
<li id="list-item">Reporting</li>
<p id="paragraph" style="margin-left: 5%; width: 84%;">Reporting should be done if a user has broken our privacy policy or Terms of Service. Reporting can be done by going to the users profile or the offensive content and/or chat and clicking the red ‘report user(s)’ button at the bottom of the content or chat.</p>
<li id="list-item">Events</li>
<p id="paragraph" style="margin-left: 5%; width: 84%;">Events can be made once you have bought a premium membership on Chattr. You can create an event on the home page under the posting option given to you. As soon as you click that a pop up will appear that will allow you to add a title, description, and invite people to your event. When you have confirmed the creation of the event, all who have been invited to the event will be notified with the option to attend the event or not; if they do choose to attend the event, you will get a notification saying that they have accepted your invitation.</p>
<p id="paragraph">If you are a parent and your child is using our application, we allow you to protect them from anyone older than a certain age being able to see your child's account. This option can be found in settings under privacy.</p>
